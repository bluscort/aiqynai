Hi! Iâ€™m Daniyar, 23 years old.
Iâ€™m building an educational platform-ecosystem "AiqynAi" for high school and college students to help them with university admissions.

ðŸ“š The platform will include:
 â€¢ practice tests with AI-powered error analysis;
 â€¢ a student blog for sharing experiences;
 â€¢ guidance on writing motivation letters;
 â€¢ university rankings and personalized recommendations;
 â€¢ full AI support â€” from generating tests to analyzing mistakes, with no human involvement.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript, HTML, and CSS while actively developing functional and user-friendly web applications.

âœ¨ My goal is to make university admissions easier and more accessible through technology and AI.
